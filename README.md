## Project Title : Computer Vision Rock Paper Scissors

    Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game in which each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals representing rock,paper,or scissors. Rock beats scissors. Scissors beats paper.The player who shows the first option that beats the other player's option wins.This project is an implementation of an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.In this project I have learned how to create the modelusing Teachable-Machine.

    - Creates environment and activate it.Here I have used my_env
    - Installs the libraries opencv-python, tensorflow, and ipykernel by running pip install <library>
    - Once you install everything, create a requirements.txt file by running the following command:
    pip list > requirements.txt
    This file enables any other user that wants to use your computer to easily install these exact dependencies by running pip install requirements.txt
